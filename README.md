# Coffee-bean-detector-robot
This project details the development of an autonomous robotic system designed for selective harvesting of fully ripened coffee beans directly from the plant. The goal is to significantly improve harvest efficiency and coffee quality by moving beyond manual labor, which often misses ripe beans or picks unripe/damaged ones.

# Timeline 

October 18: The team found out about the competition via email. Alongside their teachers, they discussed what type of project they wished to submit that would be both efficient and realistic to accomplish given the amount of time they had till the deadline. 

October 19: Having in mind all the criteria that would be evaluated, the team came up with a rought draft; coming up with the idea of a robot that would aid coffee collectors (the coffee industry employs an estimate of 1.1 million people in the country of Honduras; home country of the team) in the tedious task of collecting beans and classifying them into ripe, green, and damaged.

October 20: Having layed out what the robot would do, how it would do it, and which problematic it would tackle, the team started brainstorming what things the robot should have in order for it to be fully functiional. Together they concluded the following; 
- It will use color, tactile, ultrasonic sensors, and an AI-powered camera to identify ripe coffee cherries for harvest, monitor the condition of the plants, and detect pests or diseases in time.
- It will use moisture sensors to monitor the coffee fields and carry out actions such as automatic irrigation and fertilization.
- It will automatically perform tasks such as harvesting and transporting the coffee, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, reducing the farmer’s physical workload and increasing efficiency.
- It will be designed with a traction system that allows it to move across inclined or uneven terrain, typical of coffee-growing regions in Honduras.
- It will run on rechargeable batteries powered by a solar panel system, which ensures energy autonomy during the day and night, and will make it an environmentally friendly solution.
- It will connect to a mobile application where the farmer can check real-time data about the crop’s condition, receive alerts and reports, and make informed decisions.

This robot will increase productivity, reduce costs, optimize resource use, and make daily work easier, making coffee farming more profitable, modern, and sustainable.
