# Coffee-bean-detector-robot
This project details the development of an autonomous robotic system designed for selective harvesting of fully ripened coffee beans directly from the plant. The goal is to significantly improve harvest efficiency and coffee quality by moving beyond manual labor, which often misses ripe beans or picks unripe/damaged ones.
